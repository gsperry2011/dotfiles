* Useful switches

  --config <file>
  -c shadows
  -C no shadows on dock
  -G no shadows on drag and drop
  -f fading when opening / closing and when opacity changes
  -b daemonize
  - opacity:
  - all opacity are values .1 - 1. 1 is no full opaque. 
    - i opacity of inactive windows
    - -- active-opacity opacity of active windows
    - I opacity change between steps while fading in
    - O opacity change between steps while fading out
    - e opacity of window titlebars and borders

  - my best so far (set apps to no opacity by default):

compton -cf -i .8 --active-opacity .9
